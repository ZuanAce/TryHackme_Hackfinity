## Solution
The challenge mentioned **Mr. Wok**, which was a good lead to start searching. Since all the challenge locations were in S√£o Paulo, I searched for "Mr. Wok S√£o Paulo Brazil" on Google and found several websites about the restaurant.

From the Restaurant Guru listing, I found the address of Mr. Wok:

üìç Rua Galv√£o Bueno 83, S√£o Paulo, State of S√£o Paulo, Brazil

This confirmed it as the safe house location.
